      Before running &name; for the first time, there are a few steps
      you need to take.  &name; requires access to a database.
      Currently, &name; supports PostgreSQL <xref
      linkend="bib-postgres"/> and Microsoft SQL Server.  This database
      is where RETS data is stored, as well as &name; specific
      information.  &name; requires read/write access to the database,
      as well as the ability to create new tables.

        For example, if you have pictures
        in <filename>/home/variman/pictures/</filename>.  The key is
        used as the base file name, with each photo given a number.
        Say there are three pictures for the property
        ID <literal>LN1001</literal>, the full paths for these
        pictures are:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <literal>/home/variman/pictures/LN1001_1.jpg</literal>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <literal>/home/variman/pictures/LN1001_2.jpg</literal>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <literal>/home/variman/pictures/LN1001_3.jpg</literal>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        The, you could set the Get Object Root
        to <filename>/home/variman/pictures</filename> and the Photo
        Pattern to <literal>%k_%i.jpg</literal>.
        The <literal>%k</literal> gets replaced with the object ID,
        and the <literal>%i</literal> gets replaced with the photo
        number.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <literal>%k</literal> percent pattern may be proceeded by
        a number modifier that truncates the number of characters used
        during substitution.  This allows files to be split up into
        multiple directories for large installations.  If the number
        is positive, the characters are taken from the front, where if
        the number is negative, the characters are taken from the
        end. So, with a pattern of <literal>%-2k/%k_%i.jpg</literal>,
        the first picture
        for <literal>LN1001</literal>, <literal>LN1002</literal>,
        <literal>LN1101</literal> would be at the following paths:

      <title>Using Object Sets</title>
      <para>
        Instead of using a pattern to map to the photos themselves, an
        object set pattern may be used to locate an object set file,
        which is just an XML file describing all the multimedia files.
        This approach is more flexible for the following reasons:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            Object file names do not need to match any pattern and may
            be contain non-sequential indexes.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            The default object is configurable.  It need not be the
            first object.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Multimedia objects other than photos, such as documents
            and video can, be provided.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Text descriptions may be supplied with objects.
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Objects need not be stored on a local filesystem.  An
            external media server could be used, and &name; will
            access these objects using HTTP.
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        As described above, there must be one oject set file per
        listing ID.  The Object Set Pattern field in <xref
        linkend="fig-config"/> is used to locate object sets.  Only
        the <literal>%k</literal> pattern listed in <xref
        linkend="tab-photo-pattern"/> is available, and the Get Object
        Root is still used as the root directory.  For example, if the
        Get Object Root is set
        to <literal>/home/variman/objects</literal>, and the Object
        Set Pattern is <literal>%k.xml</literal>, then the file for
        listing ID <literal>LN1</literal> would
        be <literal>/home/variman/objects/LN1.xml</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Before getting into the details, here is what an object set
        file may look like for the <literal>LN1</literal>

        The main tag is <literal>object-set</literal>.
        The <literal>resource</literal> attribute is required and must
        match the listing ID.  Following
        the <literal>object-set</literal> tag must be one or
        more <literal>object-group</literal> tags.  There should be
        one object group for each type of multimedia object.
        The <literal>type</literal> attribute must match
        the <literal>Type</literal> parameter used by the RETS client.
        Well known types must be used where appropriate.  See Section

        limits, the lowest limit is taken.

        Filter rules allow RETS system names to be filtered out.  If

        access to all system names provided in the metadata.  Rules
        are written for a particular resource and class.  There two
        types of filter rules: include and exclude.  Include rules
        includes only the fields listed.  Exclude rules includes all
        fields except the ones listed.  An example rule is shown in
        <xref linkend="fig-filter-rule"/>.  The individual fields are
        listed with spaces between them.  If a user is a member of
        multiple groups, then the fields allowed to be seen are a
        union of the fields of each group's set of fields.

    <section id="condition-rules">
      <title>Condition Rules</title>

      <para>
        Condition rules allows the generated SQL to be modified and
        given extra conditions.  For example, there may be a column in
        the database called <code>idx_viewable</code> with values
        of <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code>, which determines whether
        or not this row should be visible to IDX users.  To make only
        the rows which are viewable for IDX available, you would use
        the SQL constraint <code>idx_viewable = 'Y'</code>, as shown
        in <xref linkend="fig-condition-rule"/>.  This gets appended
        on to the <code>WHERE</code> clause of the generated SQL using
        an <code>AND</code> statement.  If a user is a member of
        multiple groups that have condition rules, each SQL constraint
        is appended to the <code>WHERE</code> clause in a
        separate <code>AND</code> statement.  So one group could
        restrict access to rows that are IDX viewable, while another
        could restrict based on price.  Condition rules are also tied
        to a specific resource and class.  The SQL constraint must use
        the SQL column names, not RETS system names.  This allows some
        powerful behavior, because it could use columns in the
        database that are not mapped to RETS system names.

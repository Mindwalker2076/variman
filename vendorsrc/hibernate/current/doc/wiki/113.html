<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> Argus Serveis Telematics (www.argus.es), Barcelona, Europe </p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> 2.1.4</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> It's the better persistence framework we ever tried</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> Our app is a kind of framework for easy intranet design. It includes many features like workflows, users, content edition and all the application objects are persisted using hibernate.</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> There can be a huge number of objects with complex relations and it could be dificult to implement it's persistence in a effecient way . </p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em> Before I entered the project the application used JDO for it's persistence but it had several problems related to foreign keys and efficiency . I evaluated several options and finally I decided to switch all app's persistence to hibernate . We choosen hibernate mainly because it performed well and it has huge and very active developer and user comunity.</p><p><em><strong>Names and emails of developers who were involved with Hibernate coding:</strong></em> Dave Garcia System Development engineer daveg@argus.es.</p><p><em><strong>Development &amp; production environment (IDE, App Server, DB):</strong></em> Development &amp; Production (JBoss 3.2.3, JVM BlackDown 1.4.1 Mysql 4.0.x , RedHat Linux 9.0 )</p><p><em><strong>How was Hibernate introduce (prototype written, full bore, limited, etc..):</strong></em> </p><p>Full integration, the whole system was migrated when we released a new version of our software and we created some migration process for switching previous versions from JDO to Hibernate automatically.</p><p><em><strong>Length of learning curve to fully understand:</strong></em> More or less 2 weeks for understanding the new framework and to decide how to make the change and about 2 months to release a new stable version working 100% with hibernate.</p><p><em><strong>Most significant problem or issue faced:</strong></em> Migration from JDO to hibernate because I had to change as less code as possible so we had to make some tricks for get it working ;). After this I had some trouble using lazy instantiation using Jboss' datasources as our database connection pooling (because there was a weird problem when the connections where returned to the pool but the object SessionImpl from hibernate's code thought that the connection was still opened...  )so I had to switch to c3p0 and the problem was solved inmediatelly.</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> AT&amp;T Labs, Tampa, Florida</p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> 1.2.3 and 2.0.1</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> Our experience with Hibernate has been excellent. We could not be happier with it.</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> The Global Billing Platform is one of the many billing systems running to support AT&amp;T. Our particular group developed 2 applications under the GBP umbrella, a web interface for Managed Network Services account set up and XML interface to the core GBP. The XML interface is used by other (order entry) systems to set up customer accounts.</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> Lots of existing Java code and database tables to integrate with. Hibernate developers had no control over db tables and in most cases the tables were shared by other systems. Almost all the identifiers for the Hibernate persistent objects had to use composite keys.</p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em> An evaluation was completed on various persistence technologies including Cocobase, Toplink, Object Relational Bridge, VBSF, LiDO JDO, Frontier Suite, JDX, Castor and Hibernate. The finalists were Toplink, ORB and Hibernate. Hibernate was chosen mainly because a) seemed easier to understand/use and b) is happy to let you pass it the connection.</p><p><em><strong>Names and emails of developers who were involved with Hibernate coding:</strong></em> Jeff Boring, independent consultant, jwboring@tampabay.rr.com, Kevin Fay, independent consultant, kfay_99@yahoo.com</p><p><em><strong>Development &amp; production environment (IDE, App Server, DB):</strong></em> Development (WSAD on Windows 2000), Production (WebSphere v3.5.3, DB2 UDB v7.2 on OS/390)</p><p><em><strong>How was Hibernate introduce (prototype written, full bore, limited, etc..):</strong></em> Hibernate was introduced slowly into the legacy application. First, it was use to de/hydrate new business objects that had no relationships to others. Then as we learned more and came up with a stable design, Hibernate replaced the existing JDBC code for business objects included in the project. Note that wholesale replacement of JDBC could not take place because of cost. We had to have a persistence technology that could be phased in and could live in a mixed persistence environment.</p><p><em><strong>Length of learning curve to fully understand:</strong></em> About 6 months to fully understand all the nuances involved. Note that much of the learning curve was due to the ORM approach, which was new to us and figuring out the mixed persistence design.</p><p><em><strong>Most significant problem or issue faced:</strong></em> Composite keys caused some troubles because cascading. This was mainly due to Hibernate living in the mixed environment along side the older JDBC homegrown framework. Advice on composite keys, do not forget to code hashCode and equals methods. Lifecycle of session was another issue that we struggled with some. By lifecycle of session I mean when to open and when to close. We finally came to the conclusion that session and logical transaction (use case) are the same thing. We also had some batch Java jobs that required persistent objects to be passed from one session to another that complicated the issue. Cascading and unsaved-value also presented some confusion but things calmed down once we got the v2 manual and read about interceptor.</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> JTeam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> 0.9.x, 1.1.x , 1.2.x and 2.0.x</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> Good stuff, very intuitive to use, We tried several other O/R mappers including Castor and Toplink but found Hibernate to have the most comprehensible API and mapping structure. It also ties in nicely with JBoss which we use for almost all our products through the JMX beans (and more recently the JCA interface but we haven't tried that one out yet).</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> We have currently one app in production with the 1.2.3 version of Hibernate and currently building two more with the current version (2.0.2). The one in production is an e-commerce site annex marketplace that targets employees of (medium to large sized) companies and provides them with services like dry-cleaning and groceries that they can have delivered either to their house or at a servicedesk located at their company. The application serves companies nationwide (and later pan-european) but the actual services and/or goods are provided by local merchants. The application mediates between the buyers and the suppliers and the company gets a cut of each transaction.</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> Scalability and extensibility was considered to be really important, the app was developed in an extreme programming style so the datamodel was quite dynamic. The app features a (secure) web-based interface as well as a (webstart based) Swing interface(s) to manage the system.</p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em></p><p>Hibernate was selected because refactoring of the datamodel was quite easy with Hibernate. We could integrate the ant tasks to create the database tables from the mapping files into our (automated) build environment so the database is always in sync with the objects. The API is pretty mature and easy to understand. Mind you, we don't use features such as JCS caching and proxies - we did use lazy loading though.</p><p><em><strong>Names and emails (optional) of developers who were involved with Hibernate coding:</strong></em></p><p>Joost van de Wijgerd : joost@jteam.nl a.o.</p><p><em><strong>Development &amp; production environment (IDE, App Server, DB):</strong></em></p><p>JBoss 3.2.x, Oracle 9i, MySQL 4.0.13 (for our new projects), JIBE build environment (provides structured environment for unit testing and continuous intergration, based on a version that was open sourced under jibe.sourceforge.net) Eclipse and IntelliJ IDE's</p><p><em><strong>How was Hibernate introduced (prototype written, full bore, limited, etc..):</strong></em></p><p>Tried it out in a prototype application, then decided to intergrate it into our j2ee application development framework.</p><p><em><strong>Length of learning curve to fully understand:</strong></em></p><p>couple of weeks (to understand the bits that we actually need)</p><p><em><strong>Most significant problem or issue faced:</strong></em></p><p>Structuring the object graph in the right way and using lazy-loading on strategic places to avoid loading too many objects...</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> 1Genia, Paris, France</p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> 2.0.x</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> Excellent product. Non-intrusive, fast, intuitive and reliable. Cuts down development and maintenance costs, and can live in a mixed-persistence environment. Moreover, useful features seem to be added every day. (the all-delete-orphan option for example)</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> The application is a Content Management System which was previously DAO-based. Hibernate was used to persist new classes and to slowly get rid of the old DAO architecture</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> The Application had no particular challenges, apart from legacy SQL code. The real challenge was to really delve into the ORM approach, which was new to us.</p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em> Hibernate was selected for its ease of use and for its non-intrusive behaviour. Plus we liked the logo ;-)</p><p><em><strong>Names and emails (optional) of developers who were involved with Hibernate coding:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Development &amp; production environment (IDE, App Server, DB):</strong></em> Eclipse, Tomcat 4.1, mySQL 3.23 and MS SQLServer</p><p><em><strong>How was Hibernate introduced (prototype written, full bore, limited, etc..):</strong></em> First, Hibernate was used by an intern who was in charge of adding a subsystem to the application. Then it was decided to propagate Hibernate to every new subsystem. The system is currently (for cost reasons) still in mixed-persistence environment, but plans are made to get the app &quot;100% Hibernate&quot; by the end of the year.</p><p><em><strong>Length of learning curve to fully understand:</strong></em> 3 to 4 months. Might depend on previous experiences with database design. Again, most of the time was spent to fully understand the ORM approach.</p><p><em><strong>Most significant problem or issue faced:</strong></em> None that are really relevant (bugs, mistakes in descriptors and collection mapping understanding), because by reading the docs we got all the information needed to do the job (the Parent-Child explanation is a must read, by the way).</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> TDC Internet, Warsaw, Poland</p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> current CVS version (2.0 branch)</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> Very good software. Easy to use and to understand. For most of the time it &quot;just worked&quot;. The only missing thing is a mapping generator for MySQL that can also convert foreign keys constraints into lists.</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> CORBA based service management and billing system. The project has been writen from scrach and Hibernate has been used from the beginning.</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> The application is a central part on our new architecture and it should be robust and fast.</p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em></p><p>We've performed a survey of available mapping software and after removing alpha-stage software, software with that didn't work as we wanted it to, software with small or inactive community, software with weak documentation, we had only 2-3 candidates and we wrote some test code in them. And it quickly turned out that Hibernate was easiest to work with.</p><p><em><strong>Names and emails (optional) of developers who were involved with Hibernate coding:</strong></em></p><p>Krzysztof Dabrowski (brush at elysium dot pl)</p><p><em><strong>Development &amp; production environment (IDE, App Server, DB):</strong></em></p><p>Development: Eclipse, MySQL 4.x, Tomcat/Resin</p><p>Deployment: MySQL 4.x, Resin</p><p><em><strong>How was Hibernate introduced (prototype written, full bore, limited, etc..):</strong></em></p><p>Hibernate was introducted from the beginning of the project.</p><p><em><strong>Length of learning curve to fully understand:</strong></em></p><p>2-3 weeks to get everything working smoothly.</p><p><em><strong>Most significant problem or issue faced:</strong></em></p><p>Exception handling. You have to catch Hibernate exception all over the code and perform rollback/commit etc. This adds a lot to the code. A lot of our Corba methods consist of 2-3 lines that actually do some work and the rest was devoted to properly opening/closing sessions/transactions.</p><p>Lack of a good mapping generator that takes foreign keys into account.</p>
<hr/><p><em><strong>Company name, Location:</strong></em> PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Tampa, Florida</p><p><em><strong>Hibernate versions used:</strong></em> 2.0.1</p><p><em><strong>Overall rating of Hibernate:</strong></em> Beautifully elegant framework that saves countless hours of development time by providing a solid API for object-relational persistence combined with great documentation and a highly involved project leader.</p><p><em><strong>Short description about project or app:</strong></em> Content aggregation and dissemination platform that provides third party research data to various portal applications in the PwC enterprise.</p><p><em><strong>Product or App challenges:</strong></em> Agility and speed comprise the primary challenges faced.</p><p><em><strong>Why Hibernate was selected, what were the other options considered:</strong></em> Various OR tools such as Apache Torque and Castor JDO were evaluated along with Hibernate. Hibernate was selected for it's mature API, strong developer community and easily understood architecture. Integration with XDoclet and AndroMDA was also a consideration, although we've chosen not to walk that path, instead making heavy use of the hbm2java tool.
